;;; Code:

(setq prelude-theme 'peacock-theme)


;; Disabling key-chords

;; In some cases you may not want to have a key-chord that is defined by prelude, in which case you can disable the binding in your personal.el file by setting its command to nil. For example, to disable the jj key-chord add the following line:

;; (key-chord-define-global "jj" nil)

;; If you're an evil-mode user you'll probably do well to disable key-chord-mode altogether:

;; (key-chord-mode -1)

;; Preloading personal config

;; Sometimes you might want to load code before Prelude has started loading. Prelude will automatically preload all Emacs Lisp files in your personal/preload directory. Note that at this point you can't using anything from Prelude, except a few variables like prelude-dir, etc (since nothing is yet loaded).

; Disabling whitespace-mode

;; Although whitespace-mode is awesome some people might find it too intrusive. You can disable it in your personal config with the following bit of code:

(setq prelude-whitespace nil)

;; If you like whitespace-mode but prefer it to not automatically cleanup your file on save, you can disable that behavior by setting prelude-clean-whitespace-on-save to nil in your config file with:

(setq prelude-clean-whitespace-on-save nil)

;; The prelude-clean-whitespace-on-save setting can also be set on a per-file or directory basis by using a file variable or a .dir-locals.el file.


;; Disable flyspell-mode

;; If you're not fond of spellchecking on the fly:

(setq prelude-flyspell nil)

;; RVM for shell
(require 'rvm)
(rvm-use-default) ;; use rvm's default ruby for the current Emacs session

;; real auto save.
(require 'real-auto-save)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'real-auto-save-mode)

;; Auto save interval is 10 seconds by default. You can change it:

;;(setq real-auto-save-interval 6) ;; in seconds


(provide 'djzhang-customize)
